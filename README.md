## Energy Consumption

Technology advances as the world becomes more of a concrete jungle. Energy consumption rises with every given year. We wanted to see what values have had any direct correlation with that rise in consumption. Values like, population per country, to comparisons between the growth of fossil, wind, solar, and water fuels. 


## Data Source

Our data comes from “Our World by Data” whose main goal is to publish the “research and data to make progress against the world’s largest problems”. They update regularly and include data on energy consumption (primary energy, per capita, and growth rates), energy mix, electricity mix and other relevant metrics of every country in the world.

## Our Questions

Has there been an increase in energy production throughout the years?

Does the rise in population affect each country’s electricity consumption?

Is there a decrease in fossil fuel consumption as more forms of energy are being used?

 - How much has solar energy developed over the years in consumption level?
 - How much has wind energy developed over the years in consumption level?
 - How much has hydro energy developed over the years in consumption level?
 - Which countries have developed the most towards green energy?
 - Which countries are still using fossil fuels at an increasing amount more than green energy?

Is GDP affected by energy consumption?

 - Does the country with the highest GDP correlate to the country with the highest consumption rate?
