## Energy Consumption

Technology advances as the world becomes more of a concrete jungle. Energy consumption rises with every given year. We wanted to see what values have had any direct correlation with that rise in consumption. Values like, population per country, to comparisons between the growth of fossil, wind, solar, and water fuels. 

## Data Source

Our data comes from [“Our World by Data”](https://ourworldindata.org/) whose main goal is to publish the “research and data to make progress against the world’s largest problems”. They update regularly and include data on energy consumption (primary energy, per capita, and growth rates), energy mix, electricity mix and other relevant metrics of every country in the world.

## Our Questions

- Is there a correlation between energy consumption and population or GDP?
- Has there been a decrease in fossil fuel consumption as more forms of energy are being used?
- When will our energy consumption exceed our energy production?

## Project Summary

By analyzing data and using machine learning, we are able to predict and calculate where society is headed in terms of usage of energy. We used our sources to create tables and charts through Python and Jupyter Notebook, filtering out all the points we didn't need, to make things more coherant for our program. With this, we are able to answer questions we had about the advancements in resources for energy that the world uses. We've also created a slide presentation to gather our information and make it more understandable for the general public to see.
