## Energy Consumption

Technology advances as the world becomes more of a concrete jungle. Energy consumption rises with every given year. We wanted to see what values have had any direct correlation with that rise in consumption. Values like, population per country, to comparisons between the growth of fossil, wind, solar, and water fuels. 


## Data Source

Our data comes from “Our World by Data” whose main goal is to publish the “research and data to make progress against the world’s largest problems”. They update regularly and include data on energy consumption (primary energy, per capita, and growth rates), energy mix, electricity mix and other relevant metrics of every country in the world.

## Our Questions

Does the amount of sun a city gets correlate to having a “healthy” lifestyle?

- How does the activity level of a person in a city with little sunlight compare to a city that gets much more sunlight by the hour?
- Does less sunlight affect obesity levels and outdoor activities? How does that play into the happiness levels of a city? 
- Does sunlight or pollution have a greater effect on the life expectancy of an city’s inhabitants? 
- How does sunlight play into the number of take out places in a city and does it significantly correlate with obesity levels?
